      welcome: Hungarian Ultimate League I
      information: "The Hungarian Ultimate League I is the professional adult Ultimate Frisbee League in Hungary. The League was established in 2017. It is currently sponsored by the 'Well Travel Agency' hence it is also known as Well Travel League. It is set to begin its 4th season in 2021 with more teams than ever before. This website is created to showcase a possible fixture and standings scenario for the League, but it can be used to track and organize data for any similar league. As a player of the aforementioned League I decided it is a good base idea to build my coursework on. There is no authetication or admin tracking process, so in its current state anyone can add new fixtures and modify the data. I figured this is not a problem for the coursework, but if I were to develop this site for actual users I would pay closer attention to who can change things."

      programmer: "This website was created by Abel Csanaki (ac01519) at the University of Surrey. The inspiration for this website came from an existing sports league of which I am a proud player. The sole purpose of this website however is to complete the coursework for the University of Surrey's COM2025 - Web Applications and Development module. I have been logging my work on Github. I decided to use erb instead of haml because I found erb to be more straightforward for me and I could implement any previous knowledge I had in web development easier this way. I have checked and this coursework was running in the lab environment. All the tests were running when I finished my coding."
